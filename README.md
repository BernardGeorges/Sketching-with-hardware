# Sketching-with-hardware
Project created for the course sketching with hardware. This project uses rasberryPI and some of its hardwares

The Smart Carpet integrates pressure sensors into a doormat, enabling secure, gesture-based inputs (e.g., step patterns functioning like a PIN code). Its discreet design ensures that the sensors remain hidden, providing an additional layer of security through security by obscurity.

All data is transmitted via analog signals to a central unit located inside the home, minimizing the risk of remote interception. The system is not directly connected to the internet, instead relying on the existing smart home network (e.g., Home Assistant) for secure operation.

In addition to security functions, the Smart Carpet can detect movement patterns, identify users, and trigger automated routines such as personalized greetings, indoor notifications, or package delivery alerts.
